Easily embed your favourite music player on your site with "All in One Music Player" block.

== Description ==

### WordPress ALL IN ONE MUSIC PLAYER Plugin

**All different music players on a single block based plugin**

Easily embed your favourite music player on your site by using **"All in One Music Player"** block. The controls can be found within the block. By default, the music player automatically plays all the media files found on your media library.

While I recommend setting up via block, shortcodes are also available:

* `[all_in_one_music_player theme="a-player"]`
* `[all_in_one_music_player theme="circular-spikes"]`
* `[all_in_one_music_player theme="flat-black"]`
* `[all_in_one_music_player theme="blue-playlist"]`

Comes with different music player skin/themes you can choose from.
